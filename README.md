# 💌 🔐 Msg Encoder - ✨'luvnotes'✨

## React TypeScript client for writing secret messages using a numerical encoding and decoding key. 

### Created as a fun guessing game to play with loved ones :)


This is a project built with React and TypeScript using Vite. It uses styled-components and tailwindcss for styling.

## Features

- Write encoded messages by providing a number and sending to a private python API (written by the same dev aka me)
- Decode secret messages sent to you by passing the correct number to the decode route

## Running the Client Locally

To run the client locally, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
cd client && npm install
```
2. Run vite dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
